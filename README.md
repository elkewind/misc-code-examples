# Miscellaneous code examples

This repository hosts code examples for different types of analyses and data work. It is meant to be a centralized location for examples of my work that are not all standalone projects. Some examples here are taken from larger projects and meant to highlight a certain aspect of that project such as the data cleaning, an analysis, or a certain visualization.

These examples are published on [Quarto Pub](https://elkewind.quarto.pub/).
